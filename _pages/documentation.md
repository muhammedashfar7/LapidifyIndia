Welcome to `Lap Icons`😊. We have almost 4000+ free icons for your project generated via `.oet` & `.ttf`. Follow these steps to add our icons to your web project. Icons for mobile development is on the way!🔥
# Adding some codes
First we need to add a css file before closing `<head>` tag. For this add the following code.👇
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://lapidify.github.io/cdn/icons/style.css">
```
# Adding Icons
Its very simple to add icons to webpage. Just create a `<span>` tag. Then the copy the icon shortcode from our site (eg: `icon-abstract`). Paste this shortcode in a `class`. See the example below👇.
I wanted to add `Adobe` icon. First I copies the shortcode `icon-adobe`, then is pasted it ina `<span>` tag's class.
```html
<span class="icon-adobe"></span>
```
Hurry👏! Adobe icon is added.
